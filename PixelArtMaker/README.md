# Pixel Art Maker Project

Build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas! 

# Instructions

Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
Choose a color.
Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
