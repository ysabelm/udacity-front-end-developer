You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

* I learned a lot even if I’m not a real beginner. I knew about « parents and children » but the way you teach it is quite relevant. I learned : ‘figure’ and ‘figcaption’, <sup>, <hr>. 

* So far, the exercices are quite easy. It didn’t prevent me from « freezing » a few times . It’s part of learning to code.

* Sometimes, I didn’t understand the way I had to « deliver » my work. I guess it’s because english is not my native tongue. And maybe, I read too fast…

* Mostly, following advices and hints and thanks to MDN too.
